Utilize the existing 'kgot/' package structure:\n   - Add bookmark-specific utilities to 'kgot/utils/'\n   - Implement bookmark graph models in 'kgot/knowledge_graph/'\n   - Create bookmark-specific tools in 'kgot/tools/bookmark_tools/'\n\n2. For data processing:\n   - Leverage the existing 'data_analysis/src/data_loaders/jsonl_loader.py' for bookmark data\n   - Create a new 'data_analysis/src/data_loaders/bookmark_loader.py' that extends jsonl_loader functionality\n   - Add bookmark-specific transformations in 'data_analysis/src/transformers/bookmark_transformer.py'\n\n3. Configuration:\n   - Add bookmark-specific configuration in 'config/bookmark_config.yaml'\n   - Include sample bookmark data in 'data_analysis/examples/bookmarks/'\n\n4. Testing:\n   - Create bookmark-specific tests in 'tests/test_bookmark_processing.py'\n   - Add integration tests that verify the full bookmark-to-knowledge-graph pipeline\n```\n</info added on 2025-04-18T14:29:59.357Z>",

Testing approach: Write a simple script that imports each library to verify successful installation\n\n<info added on 2025-04-18T14:32:10.292Z>\nAdd the following to the details section:\n\nSince the project uses a pyproject.toml file for dependency management, we should adapt our approach:\n\n1. Use the existing pyproject.toml instead of creating requirements.txt and setup.py\n2. Additional dependencies to consider:\n   - beautifulsoup4 for HTML parsing\n   - langchain for LLM integration\n   - python-dotenv for environment variables\n   - transformers (alternative to sentence-transformers)\n\n3.
