# Installation and Setup

This guide helps you set up the Knowledge Graph of Thoughts system and its dependencies.

## Prerequisites

Before installing the KGoT system, ensure you have:

- Docker and Docker Compose installed
- Python 3.10 or higher
- Git (to clone the repository)
- Basic command-line knowledge

## System Requirements

- **Operating System**: macOS, Linux, or Windows with WSL2
- **Storage**: At least 1GB of free disk space
- **Memory**: At least 4GB RAM
- **CPU**: Any modern multi-core processor

## Installation Steps

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/knowledge-graph-of-thoughts.git
cd knowledge-graph-of-thoughts
```

### 2. Set Up Directory Structure

The system requires several directories for operation:

```bash
# Create the output directory
mkdir -p output

# Create the KGoT directory structure
mkdir -p kgot/data kgot/backups kgot/indices
```

### 3. Prepare Sample Data (Optional)

If you don't have your own bookmark data, you can use sample data:

```bash
# Create a sample data file
cat > data-bookmark-sample.jsonl << EOF
{"id": 1, "url": "https://github.com/example/repo", "source": "github", "created_at": "2025-01-01T12:00:00Z", "content": "Example GitHub Repository", "metadata": {"language": "Python", "stars": 100, "forks": 10}}
{"id": 2, "url": "https://twitter.com/example/status/12345", "source": "twitter", "created_at": "2025-01-02T12:00:00Z", "content": "Example Tweet", "metadata": {"likes": 50, "retweets": 10}}
EOF

# Copy to the main data file
cp data-bookmark-sample.jsonl data-bookmark.jsonl
```

### 4. Build the Docker Container

```bash
docker-compose build
```

This will build the Docker image with all necessary Python dependencies.

## Verifying the Installation

Run a test process to verify that everything is working:

```bash
./process-bookmarks.sh standard
```

Check the output directory to see if files were created:

```bash
ls -la output/
```

You should see an `organized-bookmarks.jsonl` file if everything is working correctly.

## Setting Up the KGoT System

The KGoT system needs additional setup:

1. **Import Script**: Ensure the import script is executable:

```bash
chmod +x kgot/import.py
```

2. **First Run**: Process the bookmarks with the KGoT processor:

```bash
./process-bookmarks.sh kgot
```

3. **Export to KGoT**: Export the processed data to the KGoT data directory:

```bash
./process-bookmarks.sh kgot-export
```

4. **Import into KGoT**: Import the data into the KGoT system:

```bash
./process-bookmarks.sh kgot-import
```

## Checking Your Installation

Verify that all components are properly set up:

1. Check the output directory for processed files
2. Check the KGoT data directory for graph files
3. Check the KGoT indices directory for metadata files
4. Check the KGoT backups directory for backup files

If all these directories contain the expected files, your system is ready to use!

## Next Steps

Now that your system is set up, you can:

1. Process your own bookmark data
2. Explore the different processing modes
3. Use the KGoT system for knowledge management
4. Integrate with other tools and systems

See the [Processing Modes](features/processing-modes) section for more information on how to use the system.
