# Bookmark Processing Modes

The Knowledge Graph of Thoughts system offers multiple processing modes to handle bookmarks in different ways. Each mode is optimized for specific use cases and outputs.

## Available Processing Modes

You can use the following modes with the `process-bookmarks.sh` script:

### Standard Mode

```bash
./process-bookmarks.sh standard
```

The standard mode processes all bookmarks with default settings:
- Reads from the default input file (`/app/data/bookmarks.jsonl`)
- Generates a structured output file (`/app/output/organized-bookmarks.jsonl`)
- Applies basic metadata extraction and organization
- Preserves all bookmarks regardless of source or date

Use standard mode when you want to process your entire bookmark collection without any filtering.

### Markdown Mode

```bash
./process-bookmarks.sh markdown
```

The markdown mode converts your bookmarks into a structured markdown document:
- Creates a hierarchical markdown document organized by topics
- Includes titles, URLs, descriptions, and dates
- Formats the output for easy reading and sharing
- Generates the file in `/app/output/bookmarks.md`

This mode is useful for creating human-readable documents from your bookmarks or for sharing collections.

### Recent Mode

```bash
./process-bookmarks.sh recent
```

The recent mode filters bookmarks to only process those added after January 1, 2023:
- Applies date filtering during processing
- Only includes bookmarks with timestamps after 2023-01-01
- Generates output in `/app/output/recent-bookmarks.jsonl`

Use this mode when you want to focus only on recently added bookmarks.

### GitHub Mode

```bash
./process-bookmarks.sh github
```

The GitHub mode specifically processes GitHub repositories and pages:
- Filters bookmarks to only include GitHub URLs
- Extracts additional GitHub-specific metadata (repo owner, name, topics)
- Generates output in `/app/output/github-bookmarks.jsonl`

This mode is ideal for organizing programming resources and repositories.

### Twitter Mode

```bash
./process-bookmarks.sh twitter
```

The Twitter mode processes Twitter/X bookmarks:
- Filters bookmarks to only include Twitter URLs
- Extracts Twitter-specific metadata (user, tweet ID)
- Generates output in `/app/output/twitter-bookmarks.jsonl`

Use this mode to organize your Twitter bookmarks separately.

### KGoT Mode

```bash
./process-bookmarks.sh kgot
```

The KGoT mode prepares bookmarks for the Knowledge Graph of Thoughts system:
- Adds additional metadata needed for graph generation
- Creates context relationships between bookmarks
- Performs deeper content analysis
- Generates output in `/app/output/kgot-bookmarks.json`

This mode is the first step in creating a knowledge graph from your bookmarks.

### Custom Mode

```bash
./process-bookmarks.sh custom "option1=value1" "option2=value2"
```

The custom mode allows you to pass custom arguments directly to the processor:
- Specify any supported processor options as arguments
- Control filtering, output format, and processing parameters
- Customize the processing to your specific needs

This mode is for advanced users who need full control over the processing parameters.

### Clean Mode

```bash
./process-bookmarks.sh clean
```

The clean mode removes generated output files and Docker images:
- Deletes all files in the output directory
- Optionally removes the Docker image to free up space
- Provides a clean slate for new processing operations

Use this mode when you want to start fresh or clean up disk space.

## Examples

### Process GitHub bookmarks and export as markdown

```bash
./process-bookmarks.sh github
./process-bookmarks.sh markdown
```

### Process recent bookmarks with custom options

```bash
./process-bookmarks.sh custom "--start-date=2023-06-01" "--format=json" "--output-file=summer-bookmarks.json"
```

### Complete KGoT processing workflow

```bash
./process-bookmarks.sh kgot
./process-bookmarks.sh kgot-export
./process-bookmarks.sh kgot-import
```
