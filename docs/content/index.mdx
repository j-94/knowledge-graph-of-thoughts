# Knowledge Graph of Thoughts (KGoT)

Welcome to the Knowledge Graph of Thoughts documentation. This system helps you transform bookmarks and other web content into a structured knowledge graph for better organization, retrieval, and insight generation.

## What is KGoT?

Knowledge Graph of Thoughts (KGoT) is a system that:

1. Processes bookmarks and web content from various sources
2. Extracts structured information from unstructured text
3. Creates connections between related pieces of content
4. Organizes information in a graph structure for easier exploration

By organizing your bookmarks as a knowledge graph, KGoT helps you:

- Discover connections between seemingly unrelated content
- Retrieve relevant information more effectively
- Build a personal knowledge base that grows over time
- Extract more value from your existing bookmark collection

## System Overview

The KGoT system consists of several components:

- **Bookmark Processor**: Processes bookmarks from various sources and formats
- **Graph Generator**: Creates a knowledge graph from processed bookmarks
- **Data Store**: Maintains the graph data, backups, and indices
- **Processing Modes**: Different ways to process and export your bookmarks

## Key Features

- **Multiple Processing Modes**: Process bookmarks in various ways (standard, markdown, recent, GitHub, Twitter)
- **Knowledge Graph Generation**: Generate a structured graph from your bookmarks
- **Backup and Recovery**: Automatically create backups during imports
- **Metadata and Statistics**: Track import statistics and metadata
- **Docker-based Processing**: Process bookmarks in an isolated container

## Getting Started

- [Installation and Setup](installation)
- [Processing Modes](features/processing-modes)
- [KGoT Processing](kgot/processing)
- [Import and Export](kgot/import-export)

## Technical Details

The system is built with:

- Python for data processing and graph generation
- Docker for containerization and isolation
- JSONL for efficient data storage
- Shell scripts for process automation

## Future Development

Future plans for the KGoT system include:

- Web-based graph visualization
- Advanced search capabilities
- Natural language querying
- Integration with note-taking applications
- Automated knowledge extraction
