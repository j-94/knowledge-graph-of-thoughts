## Why Visualize Your Knowledge Graph?

Visualization provides several benefits:

- **Discover Connections**: Identify relationships between topics that weren't obvious
- **Find Clusters**: See which topics are most connected in your knowledge
- **Identify Gaps**: Discover areas where your knowledge might be incomplete
- **Navigate Knowledge**: Use the graph as an interactive way to explore your bookmarks
- **Share Insights**: Generate visual representations to share with others

## Built-in Visualization

The Knowledge Graph of Thoughts system includes a basic built-in visualization tool that you can access directly from your processed data.

To generate a visualization using the built-in tool:

```bash
./process-bookmarks.sh visualize
```

This command:
1. Takes the `kgot_graph.json` file from your output directory
2. Generates an interactive HTML visualization
3. Opens the visualization in your default browser

The built-in visualization offers:
- Force-directed graph layout
- Node coloring by type (bookmark, entity, category)
- Interactive zooming and panning
- Node selection to view details
- Filtering by node type and relationship

## Export Options for Advanced Visualization

For more advanced visualization options, you can export your knowledge graph to specialized visualization tools.

### Exporting to Gephi

[Gephi](https://gephi.org/) is a powerful open-source network analysis and visualization software.

To export your knowledge graph for Gephi:

```bash
./process-bookmarks.sh export --format=gephi
```

This generates a GEXF file in your output directory that you can open directly in Gephi. With Gephi, you can:

- Apply advanced layout algorithms
- Calculate network metrics (centrality, modularity, etc.)
- Create high-quality renderings for publication
- Perform community detection
- Filter and transform your graph dynamically

### Exporting to Neo4j

[Neo4j](https://neo4j.com/) is a graph database that includes powerful visualization capabilities.

To export your knowledge graph for Neo4j:

```bash
./process-bookmarks.sh export --format=neo4j
```

This generates CSV files formatted for Neo4j import. After importing into Neo4j, you can:

- Use Neo4j Browser for interactive visualization
- Write Cypher queries to extract specific subgraphs
- Apply graph algorithms through Neo4j's Graph Data Science library
- Set up a persistent graph database for ongoing use

### Exporting to D3.js

[D3.js](https://d3js.org/) is a JavaScript library for creating custom interactive visualizations.

The standard `kgot_graph.json` output is already compatible with D3.js. You can use it directly with D3 visualization templates or create custom visualizations.

## Customizing Visualizations

When using the built-in visualization, you can apply various customizations:

```bash
./process-bookmarks.sh visualize --layout=radial --theme=dark --highlight-clusters
```

Available customization options include:

- **Layouts**: force, radial, hierarchical, circular
- **Themes**: light, dark, colorful, monochrome
- **Node Size**: by degree, by type, uniform
- **Edge Thickness**: by weight, uniform
- **Highlighting**: clusters, recent additions, specific tags

## Embedding Visualizations

You can embed the knowledge graph visualization in your own web applications:

1. Include the generated visualization files in your web project
2. Use the provided KGoT Viewer component to display the graph
3. Customize the appearance and behavior through the API

Example embedding code:

```html
<div id="kgot-visualization" style="width: 100%; height: 600px;"></div>
<script src="path/to/kgot-viewer.js"></script>
<script>
  const viewer = new KGoTViewer({
    container: 'kgot-visualization',
    dataPath: 'path/to/kgot_graph.json',
    theme: 'dark',
    layout: 'force',
    nodeSize: 'degree'
  });
  
  viewer.initialize();
</script>
```
