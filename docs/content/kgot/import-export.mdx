## Export Process

The export process moves processed graph data from the output directory to the KGoT data directory structure, making it available for the KGoT system.

### Directory Structure

The KGoT system uses the following directory structure:

```
kgot/
├── data/           # Primary data store for graph files
│   ├── kgot_nodes.jsonl
│   ├── kgot_edges.jsonl
│   └── kgot_graph.json
├── backups/        # Backup storage for imported data
│   └── import_bookmarks_TIMESTAMP.json
├── indices/        # Index files for metadata about imports
│   └── bookmarks_index.json
└── import.py       # Import tool script
```

### Running Export

To export your processed data to the KGoT system:

```bash
./process-bookmarks.sh kgot-export
```

This command:
1. Checks if the KGoT data directory exists (`kgot/data/`)
2. Copies the processed graph files to the KGoT data directory
3. Provides confirmation that files were exported successfully

## Import Process

The import process takes the graph data files and formally imports them into the KGoT system, creating appropriate indices and backups.

### Import Steps

The import process:

1. Loads the graph data from the specified file
2. Creates a timestamped backup in the `kgot/backups/` directory
3. Generates metadata about the import in the `kgot/indices/` directory
4. Provides statistics about the imported nodes and edges

### Running Import

To import your processed data into the KGoT system:

```bash
./process-bookmarks.sh kgot-import
```

This command uses the `import.py` script to:
1. Load and validate the graph data
2. Create a backup of the imported data
3. Generate an index with metadata about the import
4. Report statistics about the imported data

## Import Script

The import script (`kgot/import.py`) is a Python tool that handles the formal import process. It can also be used directly:

```bash
python3 kgot/import.py --input output/kgot_graph.json --source bookmarks
```

This gives you more control over the source identifier and input file.

## Index Metadata

The import process creates an index file with metadata about the import:

```json
{
  "source": "bookmarks",
  "imported_at": "2025-04-18T16:06:16.296288",
  "node_count": 8589,
  "edge_count": 1218,
  "data_path": "/path/to/kgot/data"
}
```

This metadata is useful for tracking imports and understanding the content of your knowledge graph.

## Complete Workflow

The complete KGoT workflow typically involves:

1. Process bookmarks: `./process-bookmarks.sh kgot`
2. Export to KGoT: `./process-bookmarks.sh kgot-export` 
3. Import into KGoT: `./process-bookmarks.sh kgot-import`

This three-step process ensures your bookmark data is properly processed, structured, and integrated with the KGoT system.
