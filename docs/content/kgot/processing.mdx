# KGoT Processing

The Knowledge Graph of Thoughts (KGoT) processing is at the core of transforming your bookmarks into a connected knowledge graph. This page explains how the KGoT processor works and what outputs it produces.

## How KGoT Processing Works

The KGoT processor performs several steps to transform bookmarks into a knowledge graph:

1. **Input Processing**: Reads bookmark data from the input file
2. **Metadata Extraction**: Enhances bookmarks with additional metadata
3. **Entity Extraction**: Identifies key entities (people, organizations, topics, technologies)
4. **Relationship Mapping**: Creates connections between related bookmarks
5. **Graph Generation**: Transforms the processed data into a graph representation
6. **Output Generation**: Creates multiple output files in different formats

## Running KGoT Processing

```bash
./process-bookmarks.sh kgot
```

When you run this command, the processor:
- Builds the Docker image if needed
- Mounts your input data directory
- Processes the bookmarks using the KGoT processor
- Generates output files in the output directory

## Output Files

KGoT processing generates several output files:

### 1. kgot-bookmarks.json

This file contains all processed bookmarks with enhanced metadata in JSON format. It serves as the foundation for the knowledge graph and includes:

- Original bookmark data
- Enhanced metadata (categories, tags, summaries)
- Extracted entities
- Creation and modification timestamps
- Source information

### 2. kgot_nodes.jsonl

This file contains the nodes of the knowledge graph in JSONL format. Each line represents a node, which can be:

- A bookmark
- An entity (person, organization, topic, technology)
- A category or tag

Each node has:
- A unique ID
- A type (bookmark, entity, category, etc.)
- Properties specific to its type
- A label for visualization

### 3. kgot_edges.jsonl

This file contains the edges (connections) of the knowledge graph in JSONL format. Each line represents a relationship between two nodes, such as:

- Bookmark → Category
- Bookmark → Entity
- Entity → Entity
- Bookmark → Bookmark (related content)

Each edge has:
- Source node ID
- Target node ID
- Relationship type
- Weight or strength
- Properties specific to the relationship type

### 4. kgot_graph.json

This file contains the complete graph representation in JSON format, combining both nodes and edges in a structure that can be directly loaded into graph visualization tools. It includes:

- An array of all nodes
- An array of all edges
- Graph metadata
- Visualization settings

## Advanced Processing Options

You can customize KGoT processing by using the custom mode with specific options:

```bash
./process-bookmarks.sh custom "--processor=kgot" "--entity-threshold=0.7" "--max-connections=50"
```

Some useful options include:

- `--entity-threshold`: Confidence threshold for entity extraction (0.0-1.0)
- `--max-connections`: Maximum number of connections per node
- `--include-content`: Whether to include full content in the graph
- `--cluster-method`: Algorithm for clustering related content
- `--graph-format`: Format for the graph output (default: JSON)

## Using the Output

The output files from KGoT processing can be used in various ways:

- **Data Analysis**: Analyze the JSONL files using data analysis tools
- **Visualization**: Load the graph JSON into visualization tools
- **Integration**: Import the nodes and edges into other graph databases
- **Querying**: Use graph query languages to extract insights
- **Export**: Convert to different formats for sharing or publication
